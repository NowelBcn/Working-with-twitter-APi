# Working-with-twitter-APi

With this notebook aimed to play with the twitter Api in order to count words, plotting them and make some predictions. It's currently in working 
but I let for all of you some objects and functions really helpful to work with it.

ie. Stream Class Listener 
Flatten words function
Count_words function
